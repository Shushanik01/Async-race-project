npm test           
npm eject        

```

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript**: Strict type checking
- **ESLint**: Code linting rules
- **Prettier**: Code formatting (recommended)

##  Deployment

### Frontend (Netlify/Vercel)
```bash
cd async-race-ui
npm run build

```
### Environment Variables
```bash
# Frontend
REACT_APP_API_URL='http://localhost:3000'

# Backend  
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Common Issues

**CORS Errors**
- Ensure API server is running on port 3000
- Check CORS configuration in API index.js
